# Greeter

This is a more complex program because it has two input ports. The greeter will take a list of visitors' names, and after that will prompt for hobbies that you might want to participate in with the other visitors. It interoperates with NodeJs.

Note the use of `Sub.batch` in the `subscriptions` function in Greet.elm.

To see it in action:

    $ ./run.sh

Read the instructions. To start entering hobbies, type enter without inputing any text.

If you're on Windows, read that run.sh file, and manually execute those commands.
